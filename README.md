## about 2024 works

Summary: 
Mainly worked as an SRE, building new AWS infrastructure, architectural design, and objectively working on development requirements for system development.

- Built a lot of AWS infrastructure with Terraform. (IaC)
- Used Github Actions to create a lot of code to reduce engineers' work. (CI/CD)
- Used Aurora serverless (MySQL 8.0) and various AWS resources (SQS, private connect, Workspaces, Network Firewall, etc.). (Cloud Infrastructure)
- Deployed Lambda functions (Python, Ruby, JavaScript/TypeScript, Java) and ECS to enable safe updates, modifications, and console operations. (DevOps)
- Adopted Datadog to not only set SLI/SLO, but also to easily understand the system status on the dashboard, and to send alerts to Slack when problems occur. (Observerity)
- Fixed many AWS and middleware security issues. (Security)
- Adopted Terraform to make it easier to manage AWS resources, improve reproducibility and reliability, and make it easier to integrate with other systems. (IaC)
